# JAMStack personal blog

This project is inspired by [Kevin Powellâ€™s](https://kevinpowell.co) work to create a personal blog.  
This blog showcases a modern web project built using JAMstack architecture.  
By combining Eleventy for static site generation and Nunjucks for templating, it ensures both performance and scalability, while the site is securely deployed via a CDN using Netlify, enhancing speed and security.  
The articles are written in Markdown, and include Front Matter.
