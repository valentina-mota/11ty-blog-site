    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Beauty</strong> is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Is it really?</p>
<p>Not entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Culture</strong>, with its patchwork of peculiar <strong>values</strong>, <strong>beliefs</strong>, <strong>ways of life</strong> profoundly shapes and influences how individuals <strong>perceive the world</strong>.</p>
<p>Beauty exists as a positive marker in our brain, a response shaped by pattern recognition and goal-seeking behaviors. When living in a society, our brains do not operate in isolation.</p>
<p>This concept applies strongly to web design. Today, web design guides beauty through elements, considering the target audience: the minds that will observe and interact with that aesthetic.</p>
<p>In a globalized world, there's a risk that an &quot;economy lingo&quot; could dominate all aspects of <strong>culture</strong>. However, cultural peculiarities persist, and it's in these nuances that <strong>beauty in design</strong> can differ significantly.</p>
<p>A striking comparison can be made between <strong>East Asian</strong> and <strong>USA-European aesthetics</strong> in web design. Websites should not follow a one-size-fits-all model, as ignoring cultural subtleties can lead to exclusion, misunderstandings, and poor user experience.

<h2>The Japan’s Maximalist Web Design</h2>
<p>Research in cultural psychology shows that East Asians are more skilled at handling large amounts of information. They navigate information-rich environments more easily, whether online or in real life, and prefer detailed, upfront content on websites.</p>
<p>According to <em><strong>Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions</strong></em>, Japan scores high in <strong>uncertainty avoidance</strong>.</p>
<p>The theory explains how <strong>cultural values</strong> shape behavior across societies. It includes six key dimensions: uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism vs collectivism, masculinity vs femininity, long-term vs short-term orientation, and indulgence vs restraint.</p>
<p>According to this model, Japan has a high propensity for avoiding ambiguity, meaning that <strong>Japanese users</strong> prefer certainty and detailed information.</p>
<p>This same practice can be seen in <strong>retail environments</strong>, where stores and supermarkets use vibrant displays and abundant signage to showcase products, giving shoppers all the information they need before making a purchase. Similarly, Japanese websites often feature dense layers of content, visuals, and interactive elements.</p>
<p>While modern platforms like <a href="https://www.mercari.com/"><em><strong>Mercari</strong></em></a> adopt more minimalistic layouts, older generations of Japanese users still favor detailed and content-rich interfaces, reflecting their comfort with information-dense structures.</p>
<h2>How Language Shapes Web Aesthetic</h2>
<p><strong>Language</strong> significantly influences <strong>Japanese web design</strong>. The use of three distinct scripts - <strong>hiragana</strong>, <strong>katakana</strong>, and <strong>kanji</strong> - means that <strong>Japanese text</strong> takes up more visual space, often leading to busier-looking pages. This linguistic complexity further emphasizes the <strong>maximalist nature</strong> of Japanese web aesthetics, where clarity and detail take precedence over <strong>minimalism</strong>.</p>

<h2>Western Minimalist Web Design</h2>
<p>In contrast, <strong>USA</strong> and <strong>European web design</strong> lean towards minimalism, guided by the philosophy of <em><strong>less is more</strong></em>. This approach prioritizes clean, simple layouts that focus on essential elements, enhancing ease of navigation and intuitive user experience. <strong>Negative space</strong> plays a critical role in reducing visual clutter, directing the user’s attention to key content.</p>
<p>The widespread use of the <strong>English language</strong> also shapes Western web design, allowing for streamlined interfaces with less explanatory text. The universality of English fosters simplicity, as users are more familiar with its conventions, reducing the need for over-communication in design.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Japanese web design</strong> reflects a cultural preference for comprehensive information, with designs that can appear cluttered due to complex visual styles, large fonts, and dynamic elements.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>Western web design</strong> often favors a minimalist style, emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and efficient navigation.</p>
<p>So, perhaps, beauty just rests in the hands of the <strong>chooser</strong> - shaped by the culture they belong to.</p>
