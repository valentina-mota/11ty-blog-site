## The Executive Assistant in Transition

The role of the Executive Assistant has changed dramatically. Once focused on scheduling, travel booking, and correspondence, today it requires far more than organizational skills. Modern businesses—whether multinational corporations or small local teams—rely on digital tools, cloud platforms, and automated systems. A “good” Executive Assistant is no longer just efficient and reliable: they are also digitally literate and able to navigate technology with confidence.

## Why IT Literacy Is Crucial

Workflows are increasingly paperless. Invoicing, reporting, and document management happen in ERP systems and cloud platforms. An Executive Assistant who can use these tools effectively does more than just complete tasks: they improve processes, reduce errors, and make the entire team more productive.

IT literacy also allows the Assistant to become a bridge between people and systems. Managers often do not have time to explore new tools in depth, while colleagues may struggle with adoption. A digitally confident EA can introduce the right solution, explain it clearly, and make it part of the team’s daily life.

## Core Digital Competencies for a Good EA

A solid IT foundation is no longer optional. The most valuable Executive Assistants bring skills such as:

- **ERP and workflow tools** (e.g., SAP, Lynfa, Microsoft Dynamics)

- **Cloud collaboration platforms** (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Teams, Slack)

- **Secure document management** (GDPR-compliant systems, paperless filing)

- **Data literacy:** understanding reports, dashboards, and performance metrics

These competencies turn the EA into a proactive problem-solver, not just a task executor.

## AI Literacy: The Next Step

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly becoming part of everyday office life. A good Executive Assistant does not need to be a developer, but should have basic AI literacy. This means understanding what AI can (and cannot) do, and how to apply it responsibly.

Practical examples include:

- Drafting reports or meeting minutes using AI summarization tools

- Translating emails and documents for international teams

- Creating templates for repetitive communication

- Automating scheduling and reminders

- Generating quick research briefs for the manager

Training in AI does not mean mastering complex models—it means learning how to write effective prompts, verify outputs, and integrate AI into daily workflows safely. With this competence, an EA can save hours of work each week, while maintaining human judgment and confidentiality.

## The Human Factor Remains Central

Technology is a powerful enabler, but the Executive Assistant’s value also lies in qualities that no AI can replace: discretion, emotional intelligence, adaptability, and trustworthiness. The good EA knows how to combine these human strengths with digital tools, ensuring that technology supports, rather than replaces, relationships and collaboration.

## Conclusion

The good Executive Assistant of today is both a people connector and a digital enabler. With strong IT skills and growing AI literacy, they transform daily administration into streamlined, reliable, and even enjoyable processes.

In short: a good EA does not just keep the office running, they help the organization move forward.
