description: From sailors’ logs to digital firewalls, exploring the metaphors that shaped the language of computing.
---
The language of computing comes from centuries of human work, sailors, builders, physicians, soldiers.

When early programmers started to describe machines that nobody had seen before, they borrowed familiar words from the physical world.
This made technology easier to understand: code sounded less like mathematics and more like memory.

## From the ocean to the console

Let’s begin our story among the waves of the sea.

In the seventeenth century, sailors used a piece of wood, a chip log, tied to a rope with knots spaced at regular intervals to measure a ship’s speed. When the log was thrown into the sea, the rope unrolled as the ship moved forward. One sailor watched the rope pass through his hands while another turned a sandglass that ran for about half a minute.
The number of knots that slipped through during that time showed how fast the ship was moving, one knot for each nautical mile per hour. That’s why speed at sea is still measured in knots today.

They wrote those numbers in a **logbook**, a daily record of their journey. This habit of writing became a kind of protection against the sea’s unpredictability: a way to hold time still.

When engineers began to automate data recording in the 1960s, they reused the term log for the same reason. A **log file** was the ship’s diary reborn in the digital world.
Behind every line of code we can spot a trace of navigation.

## Architecture and the shape of software

As computers moved from laboratories into offices and houses, their vocabulary became architectural.
We still open **windows**, build frameworks, and store files in folders.
The **desktop** itself is a metaphor for the workplace, and a platform suggests a structure that supports what stands on top of it.
These words were chosen intentionally.

In the early 1980s, designers at Xerox PARC and later Apple wanted to make computing visual and familiar.
Lev Manovich (2001) explains that the window metaphor connected digital space with human perspective, just like the framed view of a room or a painting. It turned abstract data into something spatial, where users could “enter” the machine instead of merely typing commands.

Likewise, firewall came from the real world.
In architecture, a firewall is a solid barrier that keeps fire from spreading between parts of a building. By the late 1980s, network engineers borrowed the same word to describe the software that stops harmful data from crossing between systems.
The intent was identical: **containment**, **safety**, **survival**.

## The living body of machines

The digital world also adopted the language of biology.
Computers have *memory* and *feedback loops*.
They *learn* and *communicate*, all terms, these, that make machines sound alive.
This metaphor came naturally, because humans understand new systems by comparing them to themselves.

The story of the bug shows how literal accidents become part of language.
In 1947, engineers at Harvard University found a moth trapped inside the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator. Grace Hopper, a member of the programming team, taped it into her logbook and wrote: **"First actual bug found"**.
The joke survived and debugging became a permanent part of programming.
Engineers had already used the word bug to describe mechanical faults since the days of Thomas Edison, but Hopper turned *bug* and *debug* into everyday terms in computing.

Later, terms like *virus*, *worm*, and *antivirus* extended the metaphor.
Computers can be *infected*, files need to be *quarantined* and it is a good practice *sanitizing* code.

## Language of war and defence

The vocabulary of war entered computing with the birth of global networks.
During the Cold War, the first version of the Internet ARPANET was developed to resist a nuclear strike.
Because of that military origin, cybersecurity still speaks the language of defence: *attack*, *shield*, *Trojan horse*, *payload*.
When we install firewalls, use encryption, or talk about secure zones, we echo **military strategy**.

The metaphors guide how we design systems, every login, every password, every wall is a reminder that the digital world has borders too.
Even our habits online follow a pattern of fortification: protect, isolate, control.

## Into the clouds…

The economy also shaped computing language.
Words like server and client repeat the logic of service and demand.

In the 1990s, *data mining* became popular, a way to describe extracting value from information.
The term borrowed its image from industrial work, where miners searched for precious materials deep in the ground.

Then came the *cloud*. The name suggested something soft and weightless, a digital sky where data could float freely, untouched by gravity, but the image is deceiving. What we call the cloud rests nevertheless on the ground, in vast data centres filled with cables, servers, and cooling fans that hum like mechanical lungs. These hidden buildings burn electricity day and night, watched over by engineers who keep them alive.
The metaphor makes technology sound effortless, but every byte stored and every video streamed requires real energy, real metal, and real human work.

Our language drifts upward, while the machines stay anchored to the earth.

## …and back to runes

In 1996, three major companies, Intel, Ericsson, and Nokia, met to discuss how to create a common standard for a new kind of short-range radio technology. Their goal was to make different devices and industries work together more easily.
During that meeting, Jim Kardach from Intel proposed the name **Bluetooth**, a tribute to Nordic culture, as a temporary code name. He explained:

> "King Harald Bluetooth was famous for uniting Scandinavia just as we intended to unite the PC and cellular industries with a short-range wireless link."
> <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/about-us/bluetooth-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluetooth.com</a>

The name was not meant to be permanent. The team considered two alternatives, but both resulted inapplicable at the moment of the official launch, so Bluetooth stayed. The name spread quickly within the industry and became impossible to replace.
Its logo combines two runes from the Younger Futhark alphabet, *Hagall* (ᚼ) and *Bjarkan* (ᛒ), the initials of King Harald Bluetooth’s name, merged into a single symbol.
IT lexicon is so fascinating in history and complexity, that a literature branch is born to express its charm: Code poetry is a writing technique that mixes notions of classical poetry and coding language.

An example can be expressed in this *coem*, a tiny poem written in the syntax of code:

`function fromWoodToWord(log) {
  const code = encode(log);
  return memory(code);
}`

The function is imaginary, but its logic and transmitted message are real.
It is both a technical process and a metaphor for how knowledge evolves.
Language records movement, turns it into information, and finally preserves it as meaning.

Every time a programmer writes a line of code, every time a user opens a window or checks a log file, we are continuing an ancient conversation between the physical and the virtual.
